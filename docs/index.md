# Welcome to my website

Hi! I’m Sarthak Kapoor, a Research Engineer developing [NOMAD](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/) @ Humboldt University. 

I work on the interface of machine learning, scientific data management, data engineering, and software development.
Take a look at some of my recent [projects](./showcase.md).

Occasionally, I also use this space to record my internal monologues via [posts](./posts/running-inspiration.md).

You can find me on
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kapoorsarthak/)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/ka-sarthak). Or just drop me an email at:
