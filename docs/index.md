# Welcome to my website

Hi! I’m Sarthak Kapoor, a Python developer with a passion for machine learning, data modeling, and building data-driven solutions. I enjoy turning complex data into meaningful insights and developing tools that solve real-world problems.

On this website, I share some of my [projects](./showcase.md) and [blog](./posts/running-inspiration.md) posts — both successes and lessons learned along the way.
